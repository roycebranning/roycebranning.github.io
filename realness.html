        <h1 class="cover-heading">Good things run wild</h1>
      <p class="lead"><em>One of the things that has always breathed an immense amount of joy into my life has been the opportunity to create. The <u><a href='https://www.southbendcitychurch.com'>community</a></u> that I was a part of while I was in South Bend often discussed this impulse towards creation in the context of a conversation about the image-bearing nature of human beings. I.e. God is a creative God who made man in his likeness, therefore man is creative.Then as the created that desire to create we get our hands on the world around us and make something of it. Some things are good some things are bad, some beautiful, some evil. But this creative impulse drives a lot of what we end up doing. I was recently talking about future plans with a friend over lunch when this "creative People because creative God" framework brought a <u><a href=#>G.K. Chesterton quote</a></u> to mind when I was talking about future plans with a friend over lunch. Specifically the last line: "...to let good things run wild". 

You see, we spent the lunch discussing an exciting new opportunity that had arisen in this friend's life to provide life-saving resources to people in need of them. In hearing the opportunity and future plans, the whole time there was just something welling up inside of me, and an augmentation of Chesterton's words come to mind that I think started to name what I felt: a desire to invest deeply in opportunities to utilize the gifts I've been given to get behind good things and let them run wild. I think there is something really beautiful about growing to understand that what used to seem like being "a cog in a machine" can be transformed into a vision of applying oneself to a worthy cause, and that finding something 'for which I am willing to live and die' might be the type of redemptive work that requires a sacrificial and collective effort. How might I be able to employ myself by the good, that it may run wild? Selah. </em></p>

That I would take the time to actually act upon them. The most recent and recurring of these is to put together master documents that outline and synthesize the knowledge I'm acquiring if different classes. A reference of sorts to save up the quick touch points that can jog my memory on the most important topics that I'm learning about. I've begun to do so with my networks class although it turns out it's mostly just a semi-outline of the textbook.<em></p>
